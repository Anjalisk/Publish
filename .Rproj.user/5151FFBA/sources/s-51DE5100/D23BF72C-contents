I am currently pursuing my Master’s in Data Science & Business Analytics and have graduated with Master’s in Health Informatics both from UNC Charlotte. In my most recent position as Early Talent Data Scientist at Ally Financial Inc., I’ve developed a record of achieving organizational and individual goals, such as executing data-driven solutions to increase efficiency, accuracy, and utility of internal data processing. I have particular expertise in creating data regression models, using predictive data modeling, and analyzing data mining algorithms to deliver insights and implement action-oriented solutions to complex business problems. I have experience building interactive dashboard using Flex dashboard in R and Tableau and conducting time series analysis. While working at Ally Financial Inc., I have also been working as Graduate Research Assistant at UNC Charlotte during which I have conducted trend analysis on the admission data of the UNC Charlotte programs.
